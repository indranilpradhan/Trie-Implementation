# Trie-Implementation

Given an array A of N numbers, you will be given q queries.
Each query will contain a single integer x. You have to find then maximum xor of x from any
number in A.
Constraints :
1 <= N, q <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 1012
Example :
A = {1, 2, 3}
x = 4
Maximum xor of x is with 3, therefore answer is 4 xor 3 = 7
